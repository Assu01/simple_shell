Custom shell implementation
=======
# SIMPLE_SHELL #
Shell is a program that exposes the Operating System services to a user. The shell receives command inputs written from the the userâ€™s keyboard and passes them to the system to execute them through the kernel. The kernel is usually loaded into a separate area of memory, which is protected from access by application software or other less critical parts of the operating system. It also verifies if the command inputs from the user are correct.


## Synopsis ##
The simple shell project is done in two teams by Asrat Asmelash Tsehaye, Mintesnot Bekele, Software Engineering students at ALX.
In this project, one will find basic characteristics of the shell sysytem such as; Handling PATHS, implementing BUILT-INS and executing commands

## Description ##
Simple Shell is a simple program which receives the keyboard commands and delivers them to the system to be executed. This shell is developed in the programming language C.  some built-in commands implement: exit, env, cd.
